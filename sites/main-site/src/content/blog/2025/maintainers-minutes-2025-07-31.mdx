The 'Maintainers Minutes' aims to give further insight into the workings of the [nf-core maintainers team](/governance#maintainers) by providing brief summaries of the monthly team meetings.

## Overview

After a short summer break, we returned with a special maintainers meeting dedicated to nf-core/test-datasets.
nf-core/testdatasets is a GitHub repository that holds the majority of the files we use for the CI testing of our modules, subworkflows, and pipelines.

One of the less optimal developer experiences the community undergo current is interacting with this part of our infrastructure.
This has been identified based on qualitative impressions from the community by the maintainers and core teams, confirmed with the nf-core/survey from earlier this year, and our own experiences [TODO: ADD LINK TO BLOG POST].

As a first step in overhauling this experience we saw in the last major nf-core/tools release the addition of a new sub-command by @JulianFleischer [TODO: add GitHub Handle] to help explore the available data files in the nf-core/test-datasets repository.
However this only acts to alleviate the symptoms of the problems in identifying suitable files, knowing where to put new files, and what is within each file.
Instead we want to restructure and develop clearer specifications, documentation, and procedures for the test datasets repository.

Therefore this month's meeting was 'taken over' by the wg-test-dataset-task-force [TODO: add slack channel link] to start the process of redesigning the structure and documentation.

## Scope of discussions

Some things we agreed on throughout the meeting to limit the scope of the discussions was

1. We are primarily trying to address _modules_ test-datasets (not pipelines)
2. We agreed we want to 'start from scratch' rather than try and adjust the existing repository

## Location

One of the larger discussions we had was where should the test-dataset files go: should we move them to a new service?

The pros of continuing using GitHub were:

- ✅ Familiarity of our users with the interface (e.g. for reviewing)
- ✅ It stays within our existing infrastructure
- ✅ The 10 MB file limit is a _good thing_ (forcing developers to ensure their tests are fast)

The cons of GitHub were:

- ❌ (Currently) makes a very large repository for cloning
- ❌ It only supports HTTPs/SSH interaction, so you cannot pass directories from the repository to Nextflow (where only S3 filesystems are supported for directory input)
- ❌ The 10 MB file limit is a _bad thing_ (some developers cannot physically get their data files that small, e.g. imaging)
- ❌ It is hard to view the contents of any non-raw textfile

Alternative solutions were proposed:

- HuggingFace
    - ✅ Suggested by Edmund [TODO: github] as a similar interface to GitHub (thus would be familiar)
    - ✅ Much less restrictive file sizes (up to 5GB per file, and no max number of files)
    - ❌ But is outside our infrastructure
    - ❌ Is actually just a `git-lfs`, so actually doesn't provide much difference to GitHub (which also supports git-lfs)
    - ❌ It would require separate team organisation (not everyone could join and have access)
- AWS S3:
    - ✅ Out test-datasets are actually already 'backed up' here
    - ✅ This is already relatively well supported by out infrastructure and Nextflow (e.g. directory inputs)
    - ✅ Anabella [TODO: github] showed services such as 42basepairs [TODO: link] that allow you to see inside common bioinformatics file formats
    - ❌ We were very worried about ingress/egress costs (particularly in our very parallelised CI tests)
    - ❌ We did not have an immediate solution how community members could 'submit' to a controlled bucket (for cost reasons)
    - ❌ We weren't sure on the longevity of services like 42basepairs
- Cloudflare R2
    - ✅ No ingress/egress fees, 'flat rate' for hosting based on amount
    - ✅ S3 filesystem
    - ❌ Would maybe need to ask for open-source credits... but no idea if available

Our main conclusions from these discussions were:

1. We turn on `git-lfs` already for the existing GitHub repository, to make it easier to at least clone it
2. Edmund would investigate the Cloudflare option to get more information on the pros and cons
