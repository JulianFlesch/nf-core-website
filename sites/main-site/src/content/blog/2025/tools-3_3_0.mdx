This release brings exciting new features focused on nf-test integration, test dataset management, and improved resource handling. As always, if you have any problems or run into any bugs, reach out on the [#tools slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE5LG7WMB).

# Highlights

## nf-test for pipelines

To improve the robustness of nf-core pipeline testing workflows and
help developers catch issues early in the development process,
we've added pipeline-level nf-tests to the pipeline template.

This manifests in four new files:

```tree
nf-test.config                 # The pipeline-level nf-test configuration file
tests/
├── .nftignore                 # ignored files for nf-test
├── default.nf.test            # The default test for the pipeline, mirroring the setup in config/test.config
└── nextflow.config            # The nextflow configuration for the pipeline tests
```

Additionally, we changed the CI setup to use nf-tests with [sharding](https://www.nf-test.com/docs/cli/test/#sharding) to speed up the testing process.
This means good-bye to good old `ci.yml` and hello to `nf-test.yml`.

:::tip
If you do not want to use nf-test for your pipeline, add the following to the `.nf-core.yml` file:

```yaml
skip_features:
    - "nf-test"
```

Additionally, to ignore the linting checks for nf-test, add add the following to the `.nf-core.yml` file:

```yaml
lint:
    nf_test_content: False
```

:::

To lower the load on our GitHub runners (especially during hackathons), we will use self-hosted runners for nf-test GitHub Actions.
These are automatically set up for all nf-core repository. See our recent blog post on [self-hosted GitHub Actions runners](https://nf-co.re/blog/2025/state-of-nf-core-ci#moving-to-runson) to learn more about our setup.

Big thanks to everyone who contributed to this big addition to the nf-core template, especially [@maxulysse](https://github.com/maxulysse), [@adamrtalbot](https://github.com/adamrtalbot), [Usman Rashid](https://github.com/GallVp) and [@edmundmiller](https://github.com/edmundmiller) for initial testing and tinkering, especially with the GitHub Actions. :raised_hands:

## New `nf-core test-datasets` command

Our newest infrastructure-team member [@JulianFlesch](https://github.com/JulianFlesch) has added a new CLI command to make it easier to find and integrate data sets from the [nf-core/test-datasets](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets) repository.

```bash
nf-core test-datasets list|search
```

This new command provides streamlined functionality for:

- **Dataset discovery**: Easily search and explore available test datasets

    List all datasets for a specific branch:

    ![`nf-core test-datasets list --branch mag`](/images/tools/nf-core-test-datasets-list-mag.svg)

    Search for a specific term and get more detailed information about the dataset:

    ![`nf-core test-datasets search --branch mag minigut_reads`](/images/tools/nf-core-test-datasets-search.svg)

- **Dataset integration**: Easily use test datasets in your pipeline by providing the download URL

    ![nf-core test-datasets list --branch mag --generate-dl-url](/images/tools/nf-core-test-datasets-list-url-out.svg)

See the full docs for the [`test-datasets list` command](https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools/test-datasets/list), and the [`test-datasets search` command](https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools/test-datasets/search).
