# nf-core goes woke!

We are happy to announce that nf-core is rolling out full support for the use of `main` branches in nf-core pipeline GitHub repositories!

This brings us in-line with the rest of the GitHub programming community since the switch to the GitHub default back in [2020](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories-is-now-main/).

We recognise that changing the primary branch that is critical for the pulling of any Nextflow pipelines can feel intimidating.

So for Gen Z we have made a short video and for Millenials and older, a documentation page describing the steps to switch the default branch of existing pipelines:

- Watch the video:

        controls
    ></video>

- Read the [Documentation](https://nf-co.re/docs/tutorials/switching_branch_to_main/switching_master_to_main)

For new pipelines, you can already select the primary branch on repository creation using `nf-core pipelines create`.

If you have any problems, please shout on [#tools channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE5LG7WMB) on slack.
