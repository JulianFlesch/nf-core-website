## Empowering bioinformatics communities with Nextflow and nf-core

Last year, we [announced](https://bsky.app/profile/nf-co.re/post/3ksi4mr6uyl25) the preprint, but we are now thrilled to share that the latest nf-core community paper has been published in [**Genome Biology**](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-025-03673-9)!

In this publication we have summarised the evolution and impact of Nextflow and nf-core from 2018 to mid-2025, highlighting why Nextflow and nf-core have become central resources for the bioinformatics ecosystems.
In particular, they empower research communities to gradually adopt FAIR practices for workflows, infrastructure and collaboration models.
We encourage you to read the paper, but in the meantime, here are the main highlights of the manuscript:

### Technical Advances

The release of Nextflow DSL2 enabled the creation of [an extensive library of modules and subworkflows](https://nf-co.re/modules/) that adhere to nf-core standards.
These components are reusable across any Nextflow pipeline, meaning that even those not developing full nf-core pipelines can still contribute back to the ecosystem.
This is reflected in the growing collection, which now includes over 1,400 modules and around 80 subworkflows.

### Community growth

nf-core reached 2600 GitHub contributors (including ~1200 members of the nf-core organization) and over 10000 Slack users illustrating the strength, engagement and constant growth of the community.
We also report that, at the time of the publication, 124 pipelines were available and that the community is spanning beyond biological applications, with new pipelines in fields as diverse as astrophysics, earth science and economics.
In part thanks to the nf-core community, we also report how Nextflow has become the most widely used Workflow Management System (WfMS), as depicted on the bar plot below, which uses citation counts as a proxy for WfMS adoption.

### Pipeline reproducibility and maintenance

Reproducibility is at the core of nf-core and in the paper we summarized how the project’s infrastructure accomplishes this goal through extensive continuous integration (CI) and automated testing.
Our CI workflows check code quality, ensure compatibility with dependencies, test execution on multiple platforms and automatically propagate guidelines updates.
This allows multiple institutions to collaboratively maintain the same pipeline, promoting a distributed maintenance model and ensuring long-term sustainability.

/>

### FAIRness and cross-community impact

The collaboration with the [EuroFAANG consortium](https://eurofaang.eu/) - who work on decoding genotype-to-phenotype relationships of farm animals - has been a fruitful one on promoting the adoption of FAIR principles beyond data, extending them to workflows.
This partnership also led to the creation of the [Special Interest Groups](https://nf-co.re/blog/2024/special_interest_groups) at nf-core.
The new publication describes how the adoption of Nextflow and nf-core by EuroFAANG led to more efficient and reproducible cross-institutional working and analysis, as shown by the contribution to and/or use of nf-core pipelines in the figure below.
We also report in the paper, how other initiatives, such as the Darwin Tree of Life (DToL) project or Genomics England, are also adopting nf-core components in their workflows, also adopting FAIR principle and demonstrating the utility of nf-core for other communities.

### Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Björn E. Langer and Cedric Notredame for leading this effort and all the EuroFAANG and nf-core community members without whom this would not have been possible.

### Looking to the future

The nf-core community, as always, is in constant evolution and we are already cooking the the next wave of advacements. Features such as pipeline chaining, the adoption of the Nextflow strict syntax or the exploration of AI driven solutions that could help our pipelines to become even more FAIR are on the works. Looking forward for a future publication that will showcase these exciting developments once they’re ready to be shared.
