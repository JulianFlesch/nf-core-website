## Empowering bioinformatics communities with Nextflow and nf-core

Last year, we [announced](https://bsky.app/profile/nf-co.re/post/3ksi4mr6uyl25) the preprint, but we are now thrilled to share that the latest nf-core community paper has been published in [**Genome Biology**](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-025-03673-9)!

[_Empowering bioinformatics communities with Nextflow and nf-core_](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-025-03673-9)

In this publication we have summarised the latest updates and progress within Nextflow and nf-core (such as the now standardised Nextflow DSL2 syntax and the nf-core modules repository).
The collaboration with the [EuroFAANG](https://eurofaang.eu/) consortium - who work on improving genotype-to-phenotype relationships of farm animals - has been a fruitful one that extended all things **FAIR**, and lead to the creation of the [Special Interest Groups](https://nf-co.re/blog/2024/special_interest_groups) at nf-core. The new publication describes how the adoption of Nextflow and nf-core of the consortium lead to more efficient and reproducible cross-institutional working and analysis.

We would like to thank Björn E. Langer for leading this effort and all the community members without whom this would not have been possible.
