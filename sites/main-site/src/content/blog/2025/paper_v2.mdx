## Empowering bioinformatics communities with Nextflow and nf-core

We already [announced](https://bsky.app/profile/nf-co.re/post/3ksi4mr6uyl25) the preprint, but now we are excited to announce that the latest nf-core community paper in **Genome Biology** is live!

[Empowering bioinformatics communities with Nextflow and nf-core](https://rdcu.be/eyqzX)

This is a collaborative paper with EuroFAANG, where we have summarised the latest updates and progress within Nextflow and nf-core (e.g. the now standardised DSL2 syntax and the modules repository).
The collaboration with EuroFAANG has been a fruitful one that extended all things **FAIR**, and lead to the creation of the [Special Interest Groups](https://nf-co.re/blog/2024/special_interest_groups) at nf-core.

We would like to thank Bj√∂rn E. Langer for leading the whole thing and all the community members without whom this would not have been possible.
