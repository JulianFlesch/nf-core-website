This project focuses on creating an nf-core pipeline for processing data for cell painting analysis using CellProfiler, cytotable, pycytominer, and other tools.

## Goals

- Fill out the basic documentation for the planned pipeline in the nf-core/cellpainting repo.
- Add appropriate test data to nf-core/datasets for the pipeline.
- Create a module(s) for CellProfiler processing steps of the workflow including:
  - Z projection
  - QC
  - illumination correction
  - analysis

_We welcome contributors of all experience levels._
