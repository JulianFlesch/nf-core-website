# Regular time slots

We run 3 weekly helpdesk slots for different regions / time zones:

- AMER: Tuesdays 2pm ET
- APAC: Wednesdays 3pm NZDT
- EMEA: Thursdays 10am CET

:::tip

In theory, this should show the above times in your local time zone,
but take with a pinch of salt as it often doesn't work (eg. daylight savings) -
if in doubt, believe the times above!
